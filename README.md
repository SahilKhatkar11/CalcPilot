# CalcPilot 🧮✨

**CalcPilot** is a next-generation, high-performance GUI calculator running Python 3 natively in the browser via **PyScript** and **WebAssembly**, encased in a dark **iOS Liquid Glass** aesthetic with neighborhood light-leak proximity glows, expression copying, and persistent history logging.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Native Python Execution in WASM**: Calculations are evaluated directly using Python 3's engine in the browser via PyScript.
- **Liquid Glass Aesthetic**: Dark mode interface with ambient glassmorphic blurs, specular edge highlights, and high-contrast typography.
- **Synchronized Reactive Glow & Light Leak**:
  - Interactive multi-colored active button press states matching specific control types (Orange for operators, White for digits, Gray for utility functions).
  - Proximity light-leak projection onto orthogonal and diagonal adjacent key edges for a tactile, physical feel.
  - Reactive status indicator dots (Red, Yellow, Green) that flash sequentially on standard keypresses and trigger a simultaneous 3-dot illumination when evaluate (`=`) or clear (`C`) is pressed.
- **Quick Expression & Result Copy**:
  - One-tap clipboard copy button situated beside the history toggle.
  - Automatically formats `[expression] = [result]` or current display value into clipboard memory with visual checkmark confirmation.
- **Persistent LocalStorage History Log**:
  - Slide-over calculation history panel accessible via the header history button.
  - Auto-persists calculations into browser `localStorage` (up to 50 entries).
  - One-click "Paste Result" feature to reuse prior outputs.
  - Prominent "Clear All" action with red outline and hover states.
  - Uniform squircle (`rounded-lg`) header control buttons for consistent design alignment.
- **Ergonomic Keyboard Mapping**:
  - Full physical keyboard support: digits (`0-9`), arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), exponentiation (`^`), percentages (`%`), backspace, `Escape` (Clear), and `Enter` / `=` (Evaluate).
- **Robust Math Guarding**:
  - Consecutive operator error prevention and smart division-by-zero detection.
  - Automatic dynamic font size scaling for long numeric strings.
